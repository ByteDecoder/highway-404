game engine
===========
- High score not saved if actually winning
- 418 I am a teapot (highscore = 10 x elapsed time + # teapot collected x 100)
- Cory: gain extra point picking up... teapots? 418 I am a teapot
- add [] and arrows to alphabet
- Tweet hight score " I survived X sec [and collected N teapots ] on Highway 404 by Jerome Lecomte for #js13k 2020 goo.gl/URL"
- Save highscore as trophy on OS13K?
- scale down car on falling road (better/easier than slow down car when on falling road)
- 302/307 redirection
- web monetization (429 speed limit)
- Nael: smoother mobile control (do I need the meta thing for pixel size and action?)
- 1 handcrafted level
- Cory: drive off road, maybe not insta death, but lose "traction", skid around a bit. You have a few seconds to get back on the road, or end up in a fiery crash.
- load all entities from level at start-up
- better music
- Animate daisies on the verges on title screen
- game tuning (try Firefox/Safari/Edge)
- nicer web page background
- lerp-smoothing on horizontal car movements -> might not be needed now with increased edge-snapping threshold
---
- procedural level generation
- gamepad support?
- Save winning the game as another trophy
- Save hitting all status codes (over time or in same game) as overachievers trophy

build chain
===========
- Rollup-friendly integration of ZzFX module
- ECT (https://github.com/fhanau/Efficient-Compression-Tool) in place of AdvZip? no Homebrew buidl for Mac :(
