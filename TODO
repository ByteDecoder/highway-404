game engine
===========
- scale down car on falling road (better/easier than slow down car when on falling road)
- 302/307 redirection
- web monetization (429 speed limit)
- Nael: smoother mobile control (do I need the meta thing for pixel size and action?)
- 1 handcrafted level
- Cory: drive off road, maybe not insta death, but lose "traction", skid around a bit. You have a few seconds to get back on the road, or end up in a fiery crash.
- load all entities from level at start-up
- better music
- sprites for all status codes
- Animate daisies on the verges on title screen
- game tuning (try Firefox/Safari/Edge)
- speach is annoying when triggering staggered status codes, play only once per code?
- nicer web page background
- lerp-smoothing on horizontal car movements -> might not be needed now with increased edge-snapping threshold
---
- procedural level generation
- gamepad support?
- Save winning the game as another trophy
- Save hitting all status codes (over time or in same game) as overachievers trophy

build chain
===========
- Rollup-friendly integration of ZzFX module
- ECT (https://github.com/fhanau/Efficient-Compression-Tool) in place of AdvZip? no Homebrew buidl for Mac :(
