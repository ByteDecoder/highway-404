game engine
===========
- 302/307 redirection
- 418 I am a teapot (highscore = 10 x elapsed time + # teapot collected x 100)
- web monetization (429 speed limit)
- slow down car when on falling road
- better music
- Nael: smoother mobile control (do I need the meta thing for pixel size and action?)
- Cory: gain extra point picking up... teapots? 418 I am a teapot
- Cory: drive off road, maybe not insta death, but lose "traction", skid around a bit. You have a few seconds to get back on the road, or end up in a fiery crash.
- add [] and arrows to alphabet
- game tuning (try Firefox/Safari/Edge)
- nicer web page background
- lerp-smoothing on horizontal car movements -> might not be needed now with increased edge-snapping threshold
---
- procedural level generation
- gamepad support?

build chain
===========
- Rollup-friendly integration of ZzFX module
- ECT (https://github.com/fhanau/Efficient-Compression-Tool) in place of AdvZip? no Homebrew buidl for Mac :(
