game engine
===========
Sat
- test on all platforms (try Firefox/Safari/Edge)
- screenshots & description for submission
- submit!

Post Compo
- better music
  - Animate daisies on the verges on title screen
- game tuning (try Firefox/Safari/Edge)
  - nicer web page background
  - speech is annoying when triggering staggered status codes, play only once per code?
  - either speak the last message triggered, or speak the first, but the speech cue can get too long if driving on multiple codes quickly
      // stop current spoken message and clear all cued messages
      speechSynthesis.cancel();
      utterance.rate = 1.2; // speak 20% faster than normal
- lerp-smoothing on horizontal car movements -> might not be needed now with increased edge-snapping threshold
- procedural level generation
- Xem: voice localization fr/de/es/jp
- Straker/Nael: highway doesn't scroll; up/down actually accelerate/decelerate the car so players can take the problems as fast as they need
- Cory: drive off road, maybe not insta death, but lose "traction", skid around a bit. You have a few seconds to get back on the road, or end up in a fiery crash.
- Save winning the game as another trophy
- Save hitting all status codes (over time or in same game) as overachievers trophy
- gamepad support?

build chain
===========
- Rollup-friendly integration of ZzFX module
- ECT (https://github.com/fhanau/Efficient-Compression-Tool) in place of AdvZip? no Homebrew buidl for Mac :(
